This was the first meeting with Dr. Jafari, the professor we will be working with on the Wearable Electronics Capstone Senior Design project.
He is in the department of Biomedical Engineering and runs the Embedded Systems Processes (ESP) Labs at Texas A&M. We are given the option of either thinking of our own plan and working with him, and his grad students, as our mentors or signing away our intellectual property rights and working on a project of his choosing. We have opted for the latter and will proceed starting next week (we have set up weekly meetings on Tuesdays at 5:30) once Dr. Jafari has a project for us.
