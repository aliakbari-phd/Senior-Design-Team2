We have collected the MotionNet Sensors, a combination of accelerometers, gyroscopes, and magnetometers connected to a bluetooth output on a small PCB, made at UTDallas by Lu Sun Zhongjun, February 2015. We obtained 3 from Jian Wu and a mini-USB cord to hook up the computer.

Jian recommends Visual Studio, as the code for the sensors is written in C#, a graphical version of C. Jian is also sending instructions on how to set them up, some basics physics of how they work, and some other useful info.

These will be the focus of my part of the project, specifically combatting the drift they create.
