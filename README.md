# Wearable Computers for Quantification of Lower Back Disorders
## Team 7: Ben Johnston, Kevin Burns, Alex Dubois, Benny Chan

## Abstract:

Using a combination of wearable inertial sensors and a Microsoft Kinect, our group will create a cost effective system to model the motion of a patient’s lower back in order to quantify the severity of lumbar spinal disorders. This will provide an objective pre-surgical screening, where current methods are largely subjective.

Two small wearable inertial sensors will be placed in line with the patient’s T12 and L5 vertebrae to model integral points on the patient’s back. The patient will be asked to perform simple back exercises to thoroughly evaluate the range of lumbar motion in all planes. The Kinect, a relatively inexpensive motion capturing camera, will be introduced to monitor the patient’s posture and assist the wearable sensors with an all-encompassing look at the subject.

This system would be used in a physician’s clinic room and relatively simple to set up. There are other, more accurate, motion capture systems available that use infrared emission and detection to isolate specific markers on a subject. However, these options consume a large amount of space and cost hundreds of thousands of dollars or more.

## Introduction:

Lower back disorders (LBDs) are the most common work-related musculoskeletal disorders. This translates to a significant cost to society. However, in 80 to 90 percent of cases, precise diagnosis is not known for disabling LBDs. An objective, quantified measure of the severity of lower back disorders is needed. A proven metric can provide a benchmark for returning to the job without risk of exacerbating the disorder, as well as a delineation between normal variability of pain and a disorder.

Our goal is to create a system that can monitor the movement of the patient’s lower back during a specified exercise to characterize and quantify the severity of a lower back disorder. The exercise requires the patient to stand up straight with their arms crossed over one another with their hands resting on their chest. The patient then bends straight down, with their hands remaining on their chest, and returns to the original position. This exercise is repeated as many times as the patient can without undue pain in a 15 second window. This exercise is repeated at 15 degrees, 30 degrees, and as far as the patient can rotate in either direction from the sagittal plane. Repeated motion testing has varied results and can thus be used to provide a full characterization of a human process. 

Our team will combine the use of wearable inertial sensors and a Microsoft Kinect working in tandem to track this motion. The inertial sensors will deliver the pertinent angular characterization of the lower back, and the Kinect will assist in error correction of the inertial sensors as well as ensure proper patient posture throughout the exercise. This data will be synchronized and corrected for standard sensor error. The corrected data will be analyzed to provide the severity quantification as well as being stored on a database. The motion and quantified information will be shown on a graphical user interface on the operator’s computer and posture correction feedback will be shown on a separate display monitor.
