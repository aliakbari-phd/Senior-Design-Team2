1. Fixed calculation of flex angle to reflect joint between spineMid and spineBase instead of spineShoulder.
Justification: This is because the location of one of the IMU is located right below the chest, which the SpineMid is closer to compared with the SpineShoulder.
2. Cleaned IMU data from the kinect integration
Justification: The IMU showed unecessary amount of noise, which a low-pass filter of 1K was applied

Tasks:
Test the database of gesture detector to provide more reliable feedback 
Modify GUI as required for patient ease
